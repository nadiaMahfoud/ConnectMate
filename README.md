# Technical Challenges and Solutions
- Choosing the Right Tech Stack
  Selecting the tech stack was a crucial decision. Flask, Python, and SQLAlchemy were chosen for their reliability, scalability, and ease of use. This combination provided a solid foundation for both the backend logic and database management.

- Intuitive User Interface
  Creating an intuitive and visually appealing interface was a priority. Bootstrap, Slick, and custom CSS were employed to craft a seamless user experience. The goal was to make travel planning not just functional but enjoyable.

- Handling User Data
Security and privacy were paramount. Flask-WTF for form handling, secure authentication practices, and data encryption were implemented to ensure user information is handled with the utmost care.

# Struggles and Learnings
Being honest about the struggles is an essential part of the story. There were moments of debugging frustration, UI design iterations, and challenges in aligning frontend and backend components. Each struggle became an opportunity to learn and improve.
